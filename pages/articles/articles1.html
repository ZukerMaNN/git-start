    <p class="p-articles"><span> it usually isn't explicitly stated in a document, company culture affects
        everything
        an organization
        does.</span><span>Workplaces with good culture have trust, cooperation, safety, support for taking
        risks, and equity.
        Good company culture can benefit both employees and businesses.</span></p>
    <p><b>For employees, it could mean:</b><br>
      More employee engagement <br>
      Less turnover <br>
      Less employee disengagement <br>
      More positive employee relationships with management <br>
      More positive employee relationships with coworkers <br>
      Less burnout <br>
      <b> For business, it could mean:</b><br>
      More employee retention <br>
      More sales and referrals <br>
      More positive public relations <br>
      Better customer satisfaction <br>
      Less legal problems <br>
      More employee engagement
    </p>
    <p class="p-articles"><span>who feel engaged in their work are typically more productive, have higher job
        satisfaction and
        commitment, are more likely to stay with a company, and have higher job performance.</span></p>
    <p class="p-articles"><span> employee retention! People who feel valued in their workplace are more likely to
        stay
        with an
        organization.</span>
    <p class="p-articles"><span> good company culture encourages employees to be more productive, which leads to
        employees
        feeling less
        burnt out and more engaged in their work, which leads to higher job satisfaction and a
        greater sense of
        personal
        attachment to the organization.</span></p>
    <p class="p-articles">More sales and referrals because if good company culture leads to better customer
      satisfaction and
      productivity, it can lead to increased sales and a better reputation.
      If employees feel appreciated and well-treated by a business, they are more likely to want
      to refer others
      to that business.</p>
    <p class="p-articles"><span> positive public relations, when an organization has a strong workplace culture
        where
        people feel valued
        and appreciated, it is less likely to run into any public relations problems that can get
        the lousy business
        press or negative social media stories that can hurt its reputation.</span></p>
    <p class="p-articles">Good public relations are essential whether hiring people or seeking new customers.</p>
    <p class="p-articles">Better customer satisfaction supposes your company culture is positive and encourages the
      best behavior from
      your employees in all areas where customers have contact with them.</p>
    <p>With exemplary customer service every time someone interacts with your business on the phone
      or in person and
      clear instructions on how customers can order products or services online, you should see an
      increase in
      sales.</p>
    <p>When your company culture is good, and you have a solid moral code instilled from the top
      down, there is less
      likely to be any internal misbehavior that leads to lawsuits for discrimination or
      retaliation when those
      internal policies come under scrutiny.</p>
    <p>Keeping documentation of everything, from hiring new employees to firing current ones, can
      help you avoid
      legal issues.</p>
    <p>As long as all documentation is accurate, all parties involved should be happy with the
      outcome.</p>
    <p>The main goal for any company should be happy customers who will return for repeat business
      and good
      word-of-mouth advertising through social media or word-of-mouth recommendations.</p>
    <p class="p-articles"><span> an open door policy at all times so that anyone within the company can have their
        voice
        heard without
        fear of reprisal, you should have an open environment where innovation can thrive,
        potentially leading to
        improvements in your products and services that could bring in new customers even while your
        existing
        customers are coming back for repeat purchases.</span></p>
